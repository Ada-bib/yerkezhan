## Project Overview

This website serves as an educational resource on violence and abuse awareness. It provides vital information about different types of abuse, self-defense techniques, emergency hotlines, and additional resources for those in need. The design features a pink color scheme for a compassionate, approachable interface.

## Purpose

This website was created for a school presentation on violence and abuse awareness. Its goal is to:

* Educate users about different forms of abuse
* Provide self-defense techniques and safety planning information
* List emergency hotlines and support resources
* Offer guidance on how to help others who may be experiencing abuse

## Features

* **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
* **Quick Exit Button**: Allows users to quickly navigate away for safety
* **Interactive Elements**:

  * Accordion sections for types of abuse
  * Modal pop-ups for detailed information
  * Smooth scrolling navigation
* **Resource Directory**: Contact information for national hotlines
* **Self-Defense Section**: Basic techniques explained with descriptions

## Technical Implementation

The website is built using:

* **HTML5**: For structure and content
* **CSS3**: For styling and responsive design
* **JavaScript**: For interactive features (accordions, modals, quick exit)

All code is contained in a single file for simplicity and ease of deployment.

## How to Use

### Local Deployment

1. Save the `index.html` file to your local computer
2. Open the file in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
3. The website should display with full functionality

### Web Hosting

To make the website available online:

1. Upload the `index.html` file to any web hosting service
2. Alternatively, use free hosting services like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel

### Presentation Usage

2. Walk through each section to demonstrate the content
3. Show interactive elements (accordions, modal pop-ups)
4. Highlight the emergency resources and safety planning sections

## Customization

### Content Modifications

* Update text between paragraph tags (`<p>...</p>`)
* Modify hotline numbers for region-specific information
* Add or remove sections as needed

### Style Changes

* Edit the CSS variables at the top of the style section to change the color scheme:

```css
:root {
    --primary-pink: #e84393;
    --light-pink: #fd79a8;
    --very-light-pink: #ffeef2;
    --dark-pink: #b83b5e;
    --text-color: #333;
    --white: #fff;
}
```

## Important Notes
